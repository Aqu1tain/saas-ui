## Usage

Nuxt UI automatically registers the `@nuxt/fonts` module for you, so there's no additional setup required. To use a font in your Nuxt UI application, you can simply declare it in your CSS:

::code-group

```vue [app.vue]
<style>
@import "tailwindcss";
@import "@nuxt/ui";

@theme {
  --font-family-sans: Inter, sans-serif;
}
</style>
```

```css [main.css]
@import "tailwindcss";
@import "@nuxt/ui";

@theme {
  --font-family-sans: Inter, sans-serif;
}
```

::

That's it! Nuxt Fonts will detect this and you should immediately see the web font loaded in your browser.
