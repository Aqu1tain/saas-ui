Thanks to [`@nuxtjs/color-mode`](https://github.com/nuxt-modules/color-mode), you can easily switch between light and dark themes.

All the components are styled with dark mode in mind.

Thanks to [Tailwind CSS dark mode](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/dark-mode#toggling-dark-mode-manually) class strategy and the [@nuxtjs/color-mode](https://github.com/nuxt-modules/color-mode) module, you literally have nothing to do.

You can disable dark mode by setting the `preference` to `light` instead of `system` in your `nuxt.config.ts`.

```ts [nuxt.config.ts]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  colorMode: {
    preference: 'light'
  }
})
```

::tip
If you're stuck in dark mode even after changing this setting, you might need to remove the `nuxt-color-mode` entry from your browser's local storage.
