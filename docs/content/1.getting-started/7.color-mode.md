## Usage

Nuxt UI automatically registers the `@nuxtjs/color-mode` module for you and takes advantage of [Tailwind CSS dark mode](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/dark-mode#toggling-dark-mode-manually) class strategy, so there's no additional setup required.

You can disable dark mode by setting the `preference` to `light` instead of `system` in your `nuxt.config.ts`.

```ts [nuxt.config.ts]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  colorMode: {
    preference: 'light'
  }
})
```

::tip
If you're stuck in dark mode even after changing this setting, you might need to remove the `nuxt-color-mode` entry from your browser's local storage.
